/**
  * We can consciously choose not to support the use case of inserting new records in storage that currently has no

  *
  * @param tx Like a Doobie transactor; a natural transformation from storage effect `G` to effect type `F`
  * @param store Persistent storage for rows, keys, and ranks
  * @param RG A strategy for generating values in `R`
  *
  * @tparam F The outer, transactional effect type (like IO) used after interpreting programs written in `G`
  * @tparam G A composable effect type for storage
  * @tparam K The type for primary keys in this storage. Usually `Int`
  * @tparam R The type for ranking items relative to one another. Usually `Int` but could be something like `String`
